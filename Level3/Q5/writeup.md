## Level 3 - Question 5

Question Name: `Th3_0hi0_plung3r`

- **Question Statement**: After wrestling with the infernal encryption, you manage to gain entry. But your relief is short-lived. Inside, standing in all its grotesque glory, is the legend itself—the malodorous, bulbous, smelly, and unnervingly sentient Skibidi Toilet. Its presence is both absurd and terrifying, a testament to the cosmic brainrot that brought you to this point.

The Skibidi Toilet swivels toward you, its porcelain gleaming with malevolent intent. It speaks in a voice that is simultaneously mocking and guttural, its words dripping with nonsensical arrogance.

"Ah, a level-1 Beta has entered my domain! Flush or be flushed! Do you really think you can challenge the mighty Skibidi?"

Your mind reels as you respond, equally unhinged from the chaos of your journey:
"Throughout the flushing and the shit, I alone am the Skibidi one."

### Epilogue

Realizing the futility of further confrontation, you make a hasty escape, fleeing into the volatile wilderness of Cultus.

And then it hits you—why were you here in the first place? You were searching for someone, something… but your memory falters. Was it constant? No. Was it a variable? Yes. The name The Variable resurfaces, but your thoughts spiral into disarray.

Your mind feels like it's sinking into a vortex of pure brainrot, overclocked and overstimulated. Clarity eludes you, leaving behind an inexplicable sensation—akin to the feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow.

As the echoes of chaos fade into the background, a single thought crystallizes in your overwhelmed mind:
"Go away… How did I even make it this far?"

As you escape, the chaos fades,
A purple shard in your hand remains.
From realms unknown, a gift untold,
Reality bent, its truth unfolds.

The Mind Shard hums, its glow surreal,
A fragile thread of thought you feel.
